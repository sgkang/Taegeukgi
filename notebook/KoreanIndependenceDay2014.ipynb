      "15th of August is Korean independence day, which Korean was liberated from Japan. Korea had been a colony of Japan for 35 years (29 Aug. 1910-15th Aug. 1945). Shamely, although I am a Korean, We recognized that we do not know how to draw Korean national flag. Definitely, our identity is Korean and we are proud of this fact. In order to remind myself and surrounding me. We would like to write an small module, which generates Korean national flag, which is called \"Taegeukgi\". In addition, we are going to write an webpage, which explains the meaning of <em>Taegeukgi</em>. \n",

      "    <li>At 8:30 AM on Downtown Vacouver (the place can be changed), we get on the bus with <em>Taegeukgi</em></li>\n",
      "    <li>Then we give \"three cheers of the Korean Independence the public\", <em>loudly and confidently</em>.</li>\n",
      "    <li>We are going to take a video and put it on this blog. </li>\n",
